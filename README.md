## Week 5 UCF Coding Project

This weeks project was based around our first foray into Bootstrap, Moment, and Jquery. I really enjoyed this one as it was mainly an experimentation into the usage of a online library and Jquery made several things much easier. The starter code suggested the use of Moment, but I decided to use Javascripts built in Date function as it worked the same. 

This was my first instance of really having to dig into the documentation of the Jquery and Javascript libraries. The first stumbling block I ran into was the use of closest(). Skimming the documentation did me a disservice as I failed to realize that closest() goes up instead of across until more time than i'd care to admit passed. After that however the process went a lot smoother as i discovered the use of siblings(), children(), and find() to go across and then iterate down through my selection.

I had time this week to do some small improvements to the User Request. I set a auto-refresh task to update the color coded schedule and also built a Clear Content button that allows you to clear the schedule and local storage. 

My troubleshooting technique really improved this time, as i generously used console.log to see what exactly was being passed. This significantly improved my build process.
